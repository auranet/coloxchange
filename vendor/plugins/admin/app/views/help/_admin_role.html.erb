User roles are the roles through which you can restrict user access to this admin area. They are record-based roles, which means that you can grant a single role
access to specific actions on specific records.
<br /><br />For example, a user who blogs for you might need to be able to add and edit blog posts, but only their own posts, and never delete. To grant them access,
simply create an user role named "Bloggers" and give it access to blog posts belongings to the user.
<br /><br />You can assign user roles to users through the user edit page. Be careful not to revoke your own roles - you may find yourself locked out of the system!
