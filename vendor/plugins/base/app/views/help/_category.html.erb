A category is a simple way to tag various records to specific concepts.
<br /><br />For example, an article tagged to the category "News" will be related to all other articles tagged to "News". Using this method, users
can find related articles, and are more likely to stay on your site.
<br /><br />Of course, this doesn't just apply to articles: you can tag pages, products, photos... basically anything can be tagged to (and organized by!) categories.
