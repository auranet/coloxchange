Users consist of anyone who ever logs into your site, be it to this administrative area, a "member's only" section, or just to review their order.
<br /><br />If you specify users as "administrators," they will be able to access this area. However, a user's permissions are very low by default, and it will be
your responsibility to grant them the <%= link_to "roles",{:action => "help",:model => "admin_roles"},:class => "load-right" %> which will allow them to interact with this
site.
