Pages make up most of your site's content. You probably know this because you've probably already tried creating a few.
<br /><br />Pages are hierarchical records, meaning they can have "sub-pages," which are simply pages belonging to one parent.
<br /><br /><b>Example</b>
<ul>
  <li>
    Homepage
    <ul>
      <li>
        About Us
        <ul>
          <li>Our history</li>
          <li>Our team</li>
          <li>Our vision</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Contact Us
        <ul>
          <li>E-mail</li>
          <li>Phone</li>
          <li>Support</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><% if CMS.hierarchical_menus %>
This hierarchical system is identical to the way your site's <%= link_to "menus",{:action => "help",:model => "menus"},:class => "load-right" %> are set up, which is why the two
can be linked so closely.<% end %>
